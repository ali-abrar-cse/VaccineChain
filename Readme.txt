# To Do:
======
1. Run the ".sol" file in remix IDE or in truffle.

2. After deploying the contracts connect them with each other by their contract addresses. 

(using ganche & meta mask as wallet & local host) // (atmost one account can be accessed/registered through one wallet)

3. Run the method "setLocation" from outside (in remix / truffle) before going to the frontend where not input is required, just press it.

(path :: Contract:location --> Method:setLocation)

4. Then copy the ABI of the contracts and put them into the specified variable in the java script section of each front end files.

5. Done! Ready to operate from the Front end now...
