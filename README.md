@To Do:
======

1. Run the ".sol" file in remix IDE or in truffle.

2. After deploying the contracts connect them with each other by their contract addresses. 

(using ganche & meta mask as wallet & local host) // (atmost one account can be accessed/registered through one wallet)

3. Run the method "setLocation" from outside (in remix / truffle) before going to the frontend where no input is required, just press it.

(path :: Contract:location --> Method:setLocation)

4. Then copy the ABI of the contracts and put them into the specified variable in the contract.js file.

5. Done! Ready to operate from the Front end now...
